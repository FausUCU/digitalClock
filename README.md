# digitalClock
 A practice project to train and showcase very basic python skills by making a clock whit current date and time.
 The interface is created whit "tkinter" and the functions for getting the current date and time are separated from the main file,  having this separation is normally unnecessary for something of this size but is a good way of generating habits.
